```

**Description:**
```
Developed a production-ready RESTful API using .NET 8 and Clean Architecture principles to demonstrate advanced backend development skills and modern software engineering practices.

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Architecture:
• Implemented Clean Architecture (Onion Architecture) with 4 distinct layers
• Separated business logic from infrastructure concerns
• Applied SOLID principles and Dependency Injection patterns
• Used Entity Framework Core with Code-First migrations

Security Features:
• JWT Bearer authentication with HS256 signing
• Refresh token rotation mechanism for enhanced security
• BCrypt password hashing with salt
• IP-based rate limiting (5 login attempts/minute, 3 registrations/hour)
• Environment variable-based secret management
• Pre-commit Git hooks to prevent accidental secret commits

API Features:
• RESTful endpoints for authentication and user management
• Swagger/OpenAPI documentation with XML comments
• FluentValidation for comprehensive input validation
• Global exception handling middleware
• Structured logging with Serilog (console + file)
• Health check endpoints for monitoring

Testing & CI/CD:
• Unit tests for business logic with xUnit
• Integration tests using WebApplicationFactory and in-memory database
• GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
• Automated testing on Ubuntu and Windows runners
• Build validation on every push and pull request

Database Design:
• SQL Server with Entity Framework Core
• Auditable entities with CreatedAt/UpdatedAt timestamps
• Fluent API configuration for entity relationships
• Proper indexing and constraints

Development Practices:
• Git flow with feature branches
• Comprehensive documentation (README, ARCHITECTURE, API_DOCUMENTATION)
• Contributing guidelines for open-source collaboration
• PowerShell automation scripts for development setup

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
Backend: .NET 8, ASP.NET Core Web API, C# 12
Data Access: Entity Framework Core 8, SQL Server
Authentication: JWT Bearer, BCrypt.NET
Validation: FluentValidation
Logging: Serilog
Testing: xUnit, WebApplicationFactory
CI/CD: GitHub Actions
Tools: Visual Studio 2022, Git, PowerShell

OUTCOMES:
✓ Fully functional API with comprehensive error handling
✓ 100% test pass rate on CI/CD pipeline
✓ Zero security vulnerabilities in dependency audit
✓ Production-ready code following industry best practices
✓ Comprehensive documentation for easy onboarding

This project demonstrates my ability to:
• Design scalable and maintainable software architectures
• Implement security best practices in web applications
• Write clean, testable, and well-documented code
• Set up automated testing and deployment pipelines
• Apply modern software engineering principles
